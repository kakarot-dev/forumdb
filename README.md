## Why Astro?

Because i wanted to try it out! I've been using Next.js for a while now and i wanted to see how Astro compares to it. I also wanted to see how it compares to SvelteKit, which i've also been using for a while now. I'm also interested in the idea of a "buildless" web development experience, and Astro seems to be a step in that direction.

## Why /src/api then /app/api?

Src is for key files to contact the main api which handles the connection to the database. App is for the main files that are used to display the data to the user.
